<p>[=As a software developer in the past I never had to set up and maintain a server. When I started getting involved in the startup world, I quickly had to learn as we were small and lean. I was the only person who could do it.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to sites like 
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>, I was able to piece together a working server for our product. We quickly learned that it would not scale and was prone to crashing. Somewhere in my tries and fails to install the server software, I had done something to something and I had no idea what that something was.=]</p>
<p>
	Thankfully I came across a website by Chris Fidao: 
	<a href="https://serversforhackers.com/" target="_blank">Servers for Hackers</a>. Going through his articles, and email newsletters, I was able to quickly expand my server side knowledge and re-built that damned wonky server and it runs like a beast! Chris's articles were written in a clear and concise manner that explained the some of the subtle differences in each OS. For example: in CentOS, Apache configuration was usually found at <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code> &amp; Ubuntu was <code>/etc/apache/httpd.conf</code>. This confused so much in the early days. Now, I look back and I facepalm. (I try not to look back too much).

	With the success of his website, he expanded his teachings to include 
	<a href="https://serversforhackers.com/series" target="_blank">videos</a> and <a href="https://book.serversforhackers.com/" target="_blank">books</a> (Check <a href="https://leanpub.com/implementinglaravel" target="_blank">this one</a> out if you are a Laravel dev). He also has the fantastic <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/editions" target="_blank">newsletters</a> and <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/articles" target="_blank">blog posts</a> on his website as well.

	Also, be sure to check out his github page. There are some fantastic scripts in there to help you out, such as his 
	<a href="https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash" target="_blank">Vagrant Provisioning Bash Scripts</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/fideloper/TrustedProxy" target="_blank">Laravel Proxy Package for handling sessions when behind load balancers or other intermediaries</a>.
